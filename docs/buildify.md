### Discussions
**Apple Watch Integration Architecture:**
- HealthKit provides access to: heart rate, steps, calories, workouts, sleep, blood oxygen, ECG
- Data flow: Apple Watch → HealthKit → iOS App → Supabase Edge Function → Database
- Privacy: User consent required, HIPAA compliance considerations
- Real-time sync: Polling vs WebSocket for live data updates
- Data retention: Configurable retention policies per metric type

**Technical Decisions:**
- Use Supabase for backend (already integrated)
- Store biometric data with user_id foreign key
- Implement row-level security for data privacy
- Use Recharts for data visualization (already in dependencies)
- Create reusable metric card components

**Security & Privacy:**
- Explicit user consent before data collection
- Granular permissions per metric type
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Audit logging for data access
- User-controlled data deletion
